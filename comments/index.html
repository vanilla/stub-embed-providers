        Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.
        </p><p>
        I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive.
        </p><p>
        I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.
        </p><p>
        I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?
        </p><p>
        The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.
